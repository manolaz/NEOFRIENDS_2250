# NeoFriends: Guardians of Tomorrow

## Open-World Web Browser RPG with Solana Integration

## Core Concept

An immersive, persistent open-world RPG that runs entirely in the browser, where children and their robot companions work together to restore environmental balance, promote social welfare, and learn to become responsible citizens. The game balances fun adventures with educational elements about sustainability, kindness, and community building, while player ownership, economy, and progression are secured on the Solana blockchain.

## Technical Foundation

- Frontend Nextjs React TypeScript with CanvasWebGL for rendering
- Backend Serverless architecture with blockchain state management
- Blockchain Solana for transactions, ownership, and decentralized elements
