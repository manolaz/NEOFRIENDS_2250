## üåç Overview

An immersive, persistent open-world RPG that runs entirely in the browser, where children and their robot companions work together to restore environmental balance, promote social welfare, and learn to become responsible citizens. The game balances fun adventures with educational elements about sustainability, kindness, and community building, while player ownership, economy, and progression are secured on the Solana blockchain.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: NextJS React TypeScript with CanvasWebGL for rendering
- **Backend**: Serverless architecture with blockchain state management
- **Blockchain**: Solana for transactions, ownership, and decentralized elements

## üíª Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/planet-pioneers.git
cd planet-pioneers

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the development server
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the game.
